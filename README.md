# Comparing different Gradient Descent algorithms

Code is provided for batch, stochastic and mini-batch gradient descent algorithms. These algorithms are tested against artifically generated data and their relative performances are then compared. A brief into to the theory behind gradient descent is also provided in the Notebook.
